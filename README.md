## Tech stack
- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
  - Next.js is [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) framework.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framwework has been used to design UI.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
 - Make sure to have latest LTS version of [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.
 - Clone the git repo
 - In terminal go to project folder 
 - Install all npm packages via running `npm install` command on terminal
 - Now you are good to run the application.
### Running application locally

First, run the development server via `npm run dev` command.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

We don't leverage API routes in this app:
 - ~~[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.~~

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
